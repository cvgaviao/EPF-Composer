<h1 class="topictitle1">Method Content Categories</h1>
<div><p>Method Content elements are organized into logical categories. The categories
can appear in your final, published Web site as views.</p>
<p>There are two types of category: Standard and Custom.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Standard Categories</h4><p>Standard Categories provide
a means to categorize core method content in line with the best practices
for creating structured methods. Standard Categories are linked with a specific
method content type, e.g. Disciplines contain only tasks. </p>
<div class="p">Standard
Category types are:<ul><li><strong>Disciplines</strong> - A discipline is a collection of <a href="task.html#task">Tasks</a> that are related to a major area of concern within
the overall IT environment. For example, on a software development project,
it is common to perform certain requirements tasks in close coordination with
analysis and design tasks. Separating these tasks into separate disciplines
makes the tasks easier to comprehend. Disciplines can be organized using Discipline
Groupings.</li>
<li><strong>Domains</strong> - A Domain is a refineable, logical, hierarchy of related <a href="workproduct.html#workproduct">Work Products</a> grouped
together based on timing, resources, or relationship. While a Domain categorizes
many work products, a work product belongs to only one Domain. Domains can
be further divided into sub-domains. </li>
<li><strong>Work Product Kinds</strong> - Work Product Kind is another category for
grouping <a href="workproduct.html#workproduct">Work Products</a>.
A work product can have many work product kinds. As an example, you might
want to have a series of work product kinds that correspond to the overall
intent of work products, such as specification, plan, or model.</li>
<li><strong>Role Sets</strong> - A Role Set is used to group <a href="role.html#role">Roles</a> with certain commonalities together. For example,
in a software development environment, an Analyst role set could be used to
group together roles such as Business Process Analyst, System Analyst and
Requirements Specifier. Each of these roles work with similar techniques and
have overlapping skills, but may be responsible for performing certain tasks
and creating certain work products. Role sets can be organized using Role
Set Groupings.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong> - Tools is a container for <a href="toolmentor.html#toolmentor">Tool Mentors</a>. Tools can also provide general descriptions
of a tool and it's general capabilities.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Custom Categories</h4><p>Custom Categories are highly customizable
and can contain any type of element. Custom Categories allow you to categorize
content according to any scheme you want and can then be used to compose publishable
Views, providing a means to organize the method content prior to publishing.
For example, you could create a custom category that logically organizes content
relevant to your development organization department, such as a Testing category
that groups together all roles, work products, tasks, and guidance elements
relevant to testing.</p>
