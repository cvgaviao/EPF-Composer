<h1 class="topictitle1">Develop a Team Allocation Structure</h1>
<div><div class="p">In the Team Allocation view, you can create a process by defining
which roles participate in activities and find responsible work products and
tasks from there. You can also review the roles in a process that has been
created by adding tasks or work products to the process. Before you create
a team allocation structure, ensure the configuration selected in the tool
bar is the same as the configuration you selected as the default configuration
for your process.</div>
<div class="section">To develop a team allocation structure:</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>To access the team allocation editor, select the <strong>Team Allocation</strong> tab
in the process editor.</span> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For the purposes of this topic, the
breakdown element example used is <a href="activity.html#activity">Activity</a>.
Other breakdown elements include (but are not limited to) <a href="phase.html#phase">Phase</a> and <a href="iteration.html#iteration">Iteration</a>.
The element you use depends on the scope of the process you create.</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Right click the element (either a <a href="capabilitypattern.html#capabilitypattern">Capability Pattern</a> or <a href="deliveryprocess.html#deliveryprocess">Delivery Process</a>) to which you want to add structure, and then click <strong>New
Child &gt; Activity</strong> to create a new activity. If needed, create more activities
to set up your breakdown structure. Activities (as well as phases and iterations)
can be nested inside each other according to how each relates in the hierarchy.
You can add roles directly to your activities.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Configuration view, review the list of roles. In this view,
tasks are sorted by role sets.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Drill into the role sets hierarchy to see which roles are available
in this configuration.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select a role and drag it on top of the appropriate activity. The
role is added as a role descriptor. If the role is responsible for work products
in the configuration's method content, a wizard appears prompting you to add
work products.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select one or more work products and then click <strong>OK</strong>. For
each selected work product the next wizard window prompts you to select tasks
that produce these work products. Again, select one or more tasks and then
click <strong>OK</strong> to add these elements to your process.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Review the role descriptor's details in its properties view. If
the properties view is not displayed, in the work breakdown structure editor,
right click the role and then select <strong>Properties</strong>. Use the tabs on the
side of the properties view to review different aspects of the role descriptor.
In the properties view, you can also perform individual modifications of the
role descriptor, such as change the presentation name, add textual descriptions,
change work products the role is responsible for, and more. When changing
the task descriptor's relationships under the roles or work products tabs,
you can add new elements from your method content by clicking the <strong>Add...</strong> button,
or connect your task descriptor with tasks already present in this activity.
For more information, see <a href="processelementpropertiesview.html#processelementpropertiesview">Process Element Properties View</a></span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Continue adding roles to your activities.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section">You can preview what your process will look like in a published Web
site at any time by switching to the <a href="browsingperspective.html#browingperspective">Browsing Perspective</a> and then selecting the process, or an activity in the
process, in the <a href="configurationview.html">Configuration View</a>. You can use the
links on the page to navigate through the process. Switch back to the <a href="authoringperspective.html#authoringperspective">Authoring Perspective</a> to
continue editing your process.</div>
