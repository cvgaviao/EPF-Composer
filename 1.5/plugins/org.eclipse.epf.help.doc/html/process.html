<h1 class="topictitle1">Process</h1>
<div><div class="section"><p>A <span class="keyword">process</span> describes how a particular piece
of work should be done. The work may have a relatively small scope, in which
case it can be described as a capability pattern, or may address a full project
lifecycle, in which case it can be described as a delivery process. A process
can reuse method elements and combines them into a structure and sequence
for carrying out work.</p>
<p>There are two main types of process, a <a href="capabilitypattern.html#capabilitypattern">Capability Pattern</a> and
a <a href="deliveryprocess.html#deliveryprocess">Delivery Process</a>.
A capability pattern is a special process that describes a reusable cluster
of activities in common process areas, while a delivery process describes
a complete and integrated approach for performing a specific type of project.</p>
<p>Each
time a task is included in a process, a reference object to that task is created
in the context of the process. This is called a task descriptor. The same
task can be referenced any number of times in the same process. In other words,
one task can have many task descriptors. A task descriptor can also modify
the base task without actually changing the task. For example, roles and work
products can be added or suppressed, and steps can be suppressed or re-sequenced.</p>
<p>Roles
and work products can also be included in processes as role descriptors and
work product descriptors. Roles and work products can be customized to fit
with the content of the process in which they are used.</p>
