<h1 class="topictitle1">Method Content</h1>
<div><p>Method content provides step-by-step explanations, describing
how specific development goals are achieved, independent of the placement
of these steps within a development lifecycle. Processes take these method
elements and relate them into semi-ordered sequences that are customized to
specific types of projects.</p>
<p>Method content elements are:</p>
<ul><li><a href="task.html#task">Task</a></li>
<li><a href="role.html#role">Role</a></li>
<li><a href="workproduct.html#workproduct">Work Product</a></li>
<li><a href="guidance.html">Guidance</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A Process Engineer authors these elements, defines the relationships between
them, and then categorizes them. Method content provides step-by-step explanations,
describing how specific development goals are achieved independent of the
placement of these steps within a development lifecycle. Processes take these
method elements and relate them into semi-ordered sequences that are customized
to specific types of projects.</p>
<p>For example, a software development project that develops an application
from scratch performs development tasks such as "Develop Vision" or "Use Case
Design" similar to a project that extends an existing software system. However,
the two projects will perform the tasks at different points in time with a
different emphasis, i.e., they perform the steps of these tasks at different
points of time and perhaps apply individual variations and additions. </p>
<p>Method content elements are contained within method content packages which,
in turn, are contained within a Method plug-in. In order to separate your
own content from original OpenUP content, you should always create new
method content in a method plug-in that you produce. Creating method content
in a method plug-in of your own also allows you to update your own library
with new releases of the OpenUP library without affecting the content
that you have created in your own plug-ins.</p>
