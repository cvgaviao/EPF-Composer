<h1 class="topictitle1">Apply a Capability Pattern</h1>
<div><div class="p">When developing a process, it is not necessary to develop the process
from scratch, adding descriptors one by one. You can reuse existing capability
patterns or even capability pattern parts to individually customize the pattern's
content to the particular situation for which it is applied. A capability
pattern must be applied to one specific activity in a process. For more information
see <a href="capabilitypattern.html#capabilitypattern">Capability Pattern</a>.</div>
<div class="section">There are two ways to apply a Capability Pattern: Copy and Extend. <p><strong>Copy
a capability pattern:</strong></p>
<div class="p">If a capability pattern is copied into a process,
method content elements in the capability pattern are disconnected from the
original. The capability pattern elements can be altered, deleted or changed
as you want in the process editor without affecting the original method content
elements. Method elements in a copied capability pattern appear in regular
black font. To copy a capability pattern:<ol><li>In the <a href="configurationview.html#configurationview">Configuration View</a>,
select a capability pattern or its parts that you want to copy into an activity
in a process and drag the pattern or parts into the activity to which you
want it to apply. To select multiple activities in a capability pattern, press
the CTRL or SHIFT keys while you select. </li>
<li>In the pop-up box that appears, click <strong>Copy</strong>. The capability pattern
name is displayed in black and is now available for you to edit.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="p">Or,<ol><li>In the process view, right click an activity, and then click <strong>Apply
Pattern &gt; Copy</strong>. The Select Dialog For Processes window appears.</li>
<li>Drill down into the process tree until you locate the capability pattern
you want to copy.</li>
<li>Select the pattern, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. The Select Dialog For Processes
window closes and the capability pattern is applied.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong>Extend a capability pattern:</strong></p>
<div class="p">If a capability pattern
is extended into a process, method content elements in the Capability Pattern
retain a connection to the original. Extended capability pattern elements
cannot be deleted or modified and appear as read-only in a green-italic font.
To extend a capability pattern: <ol><li>In the <a href="configurationview.html#configurationview">Configuration View</a>,
select a capability pattern or its parts that you want to extend into an activity
in a process and drag the pattern or parts into the activity to which you
want it to apply. To select multiple activities in a capability pattern, press
the CTRL or SHIFT keys while you select.</li>
<li>In the pop-up box that appears, click <strong>Extend</strong>. The capability pattern
name is displayed in green, which indicates it is part of a process defined
elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="p">Or, <ol><li>In the process view, right click an activity and then click <strong>Apply
Pattern &gt; Extend</strong>. The Select Dialog For Processes window appears.</li>
<li>Drill down into the process tree until you locate the capability pattern
you want to extend.</li>
<li>Select the pattern, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. The Select Dialog For Processes
window closes and the capability pattern is applied.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="p"><div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you do not want a specific activity or task in the capability
pattern to be included in your process you can suppress it. The activity or
task will not appear in the published process or be exported to a project
planning tool. To suppress a process element, right click the element and
then select <strong>Suppress</strong>. The element appears grayed out in the process
view.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><div class="p">To add elements to an activity in an extended capability pattern:<ol><li>Find the activity's parent element. If this element is a not a local element
that appears in green italic font, then you need create a contribution to
this parent first.  If the parent's parent is not local, also appearing in
green italic font, then you need to create a contribution to the parent first,
and so on. </li>
<li>To create a contribution to an extended activity, right click the extended
activity and then click <strong>Contribute</strong>. The activity becomes local and
appears in a standard black font. Do this with all parent elements, top-down,
until you reach the activity to which you want to apply the element. Once
you click Contribute, the activity becomes local and is presented in standard
black font.</li>
</ol>
