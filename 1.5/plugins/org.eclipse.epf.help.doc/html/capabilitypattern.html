<h1 class="topictitle1">Capability Pattern</h1>
<div><p>A Capability pattern is a special process that describes a reusable cluster
of activities in common process areas. Capability patterns express and communicate
process knowledge for a key area of interest such as a discipline and can
be directly used by a process practitioner to guide his work. Capability patterns
are also used as building blocks to assemble Delivery processes or larger
capability patterns ensuring optimal reuse and application of the key practices
they express.</p>
<p>Examples of a capability pattern could be "use case-based requirements
management", "use case analysis", or "unit testing". Typically, but not necessarily,
capability patterns have the scope of one discipline providing a breakdown
of reusable complex activities, relationships to the roles which perform tasks
within these activities, as well as to the work products that are used and
produced. A capability pattern does not relate to any specific
phase or iteration of a development lifecycle, and should not imply any. In
other words, a pattern should be designed in a way that it is applicable anywhere
in a delivery process. thereby enabling its activities to be flexibly assigned
to whatever phases there are in the delivery process to which it is being
applied.</p>
