<h1 class="topictitle1">Process Element Properties View</h1>
<div><p>When you are editing a process, the process element properties view allows
you to edit all the details for a single element in the process. If you click
in any row in a process display, you will see the full details of the process
element in the row in the properties view.</p>
<p>If the properties view is not open, right click any row in a process and
select <strong>Show Properties View</strong>.</p>
<p>The properties view is the editor for activities, task descriptors, roles
descriptors, and work product descriptors. The information for
a descriptor is similar to the corresponding method element editor, but it
also has information related to the element in the process. The process information
is also displayed in the corresponding row in the process display.</p>
<p><strong>General Information tab:</strong></p>
<p>The Name and Presentation Name default to the corresponding names in the
base method element. These names can be changed in a descriptor.</p>
<div class="p">The following attributes are used to specify certain aspects of the element
in the process and can be set for all types of process elements:<ul><li><strong>Optional</strong>: If this is checked (true), it indicates that the element
is considered optional in the process. This means that it is safe to remove
the element. If this is not checked (false), the element is considered mandatory
and should not be removed from the process.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Occurrences</strong>: If this is checked (true), it indicates that
when the process is instantiated as a project or other process, it is expected
that there will be multiple occurrences of this element. If this is not checked
(false), it indicates that there should only be a single occurrence of this
element when the process is instantiated.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: If this is checked (true), the element will be included
in an export to a project management tool. If this is not checked (false),
it will not be included in an export.</li>
<li><strong>Suppressed</strong>: If this is checked (true), the element will not appear
in a published process. This is usually used to modify a capability pattern
included in a process. This is not checked (false) as default.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="p">The following elements can be set for task descriptors and activities:<ul><li><strong>Event Driven</strong>: If this is checked (true), it indicates that the
task or activity will be initiated when a particular event occurs. If this
is not checked (false), it indicates that the task or activity will be initiated
based on other tasks in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing</strong>: If this is checked (true), it indicates that the task
or activity is continuous. If this is not checked (false), it indicates that
the task or activity has a clear start and finish in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Repeatable</strong>: If this is checked (true), it indicates that the task
or activity can iterate when the process is instantiated. If this is not checked
(false), it indicates that the task or activity will only occur once in the
process.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Dependency Field: You can add one or more dependencies for a task or activity.
Click the <strong>Add...</strong> button and enter the index number for the task or
activity on which the current element is dependent. The dependency (type)
defaults to Finish-to-Start. If you want to set another dependency type, click
the <strong>Edit</strong> button and select the required dependency type in the dependency
drop down box. You can enter a different index number on the Edit dialog.
You can also remove a dependency by selecting the dependency and clicking
the <strong>Remove</strong> button.</p>
<p>The base method element for the descriptor is displayed on the page. You
can select a different element by clicking the <strong>Link Method Element</strong> button
and selecting the required element.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation tab:</strong></p>
<p>The documentation tab contains descriptive attributes for the descriptor
or activity.</p>
<p><strong>Roll-Up tabs:</strong></p>
<p>The properties view for an activity includes roll-up tabs that provide
lists of tasks, roles, or work products "rolled up", or summarized, for the
activity.</p>
<p><strong>Association tabs:</strong></p>
<p>The remaining tabs are used to add or remove associations between the activity
or descriptor to method elements.</p>
