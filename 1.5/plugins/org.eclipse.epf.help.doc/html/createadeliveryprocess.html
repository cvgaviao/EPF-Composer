<h1 class="topictitle1">Create a Delivery Process</h1>
<div><div class="p"><p>A Delivery Process describes a complete and integrated approach
for performing a specific type of project. A Delivery Process describes what
is produced, how it is produced and the required staffing for the entire project
lifecycle.</p>
A Delivery Process is created for a particular type of project
to reflect the specific planning and project management needs. <p>Before
creating a delivery process:</p>
<ul><li>Select a method plug-in to hold your process. For more information, see <a href="methodplugin.html#methodplugin">Method Plug-in</a>.</li>
<li>Find or create a process package.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">There are several ways to populate a process with method elements:<ul><li>By incorporating individual method elements by dragging the elements onto
an activity in the process.</li>
<li>By including already defined capability patterns.</li>
<li>By including parts of already defined capability patterns.</li>
<li>By creating descriptors directly in the process, which are either unrelated
to any method content or related to method content at a later point in time.</li>
</ul>
To create a Delivery Process:</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>Once you have selected or created a process package, right click
the process package.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <strong>New &gt; Delivery Process</strong>. The New Process Component
dialog appears.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Type a name for the delivery process into the <strong>Name</strong> field
and then select a default configuration from the drop down list. Your process
can contain content from many different method plug-ins. for this reason you
need to define a configuration that defines the visible set of elements and
relationships when the process is authored. This process authoring configuration
is referred to as the Default Configuration for the process and should define
the largest reasonable set of method plug-ins, content packages, and other
processes from the method library that will be referred to by the process
at some point.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The process is created and the process editor
is opened.</span> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If the Properties window opens to the right of
the process editor, click the <strong>x</strong> to close it.</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the process editor, under the Description tab, document your
process using the available text fields.</span> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can use the
Rich Text Editor to edit or enter the text for any field that has a twisty
symbol <img src="collapsed.gif" alt="" />. Simply click the symbol
to access the Rich Text Editor. Click the symbol again to close the Rich Text
Editor. For more information see <a href="richtexteditor.html#richtexteditor">Rich Text Editor</a></div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Decide on your primary process authoring view. You develop a process
using three different views:</span><ul><li><strong>Work Breakdown Structure</strong>: Define a work breakdown structure
in your process. Create iterations and activities first, and then populate
your activities by applying tasks from your Method Content. For more information
see <a href="developaworkbreakdownstructure.html">Develop a Work Breakdown Structure</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Team Allocation</strong>: Define which teams and roles shall participate
in activities and then find responsible work products and tasks from there.
For more information, see <a href="developateamallocationstructure.html#developateamallocationstructure">Develop a Team Allocation Structure</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Work Product Usage</strong>: Define which work products should be created
in activities and find tasks and roles from there. For more information see <a href="developaworkproductusagestructure.html#developaworkproductusagestructure">Develop a Work Product Usage Structure</a>.</li>
</ul>
