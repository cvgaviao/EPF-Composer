<ul><li>Method Author</li>
<li>Process Author</li>
<li>Process Configurator</li>
<li>Practitioner</li>
</ul>
<div class="p"><strong>Method Author</strong> - The Method Author uses the tool on a regular basis
to provide standard processes for use in an organization. The Method Author
uses the full functionality of the tool to:<ul><li>Create plug-ins.</li>
<li>Create new method elements.</li>
<li>Extend existing method elements.</li>
<li>Create reusable capability patterns by reusing method elements.</li>
<li>Create delivery processes by reusing capability patterns and method elements.</li>
<li>Create custom categories for use as views in a configuration.</li>
<li>Create and modify configurations.</li>
<li>Publish configurations or processes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="p"><strong>Process Author</strong> - The Process Author's goal is to produce a delivery
process for their project(s) by reusing method elements. The Process Author
uses the tool occasionally, as project needs dictate, typically supporting
one or, more likely, several projects by specifying the processes to be followed.
The Process Author uses the process authoring and configuration publishing
functionality of this tool to:<ul><li>Create plug-ins.</li>
<li>Create reusable capability patterns by reusing method elements.</li>
<li>Create delivery processes by reusing capability patterns and method elements.</li>
<li>Create custom categories for use as views in a configuration. </li>
<li>Create and modify configurations.</li>
<li>Publish configurations or processes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="p"><strong>Process Configurator</strong> - The Process Configurator's goal is to produce
a delivery process for their project(s) by rapidly leveraging ready-made plug-ins.
The Process Configurator uses this tool occasional, as project needs dictate,
typically supporting one or several projects by specifying the process for
the projects. The Process Configurator uses the configuration
publishing functionality in this tool to:<ul><li>Create and modify configurations.</li>
<li>Publish configurations or processes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Practitioner</strong> - A Practitioner's goal is to correctly use the organization's

processes and methods.</p>
