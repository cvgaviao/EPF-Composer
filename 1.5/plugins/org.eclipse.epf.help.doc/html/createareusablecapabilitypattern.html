<h1 class="topictitle1">Create a Reusable Capability Pattern</h1>
<div><div class="p"><p>A Capability pattern is a special process that describes a reusable
cluster of activities in a general process area that provides a consistent
development approach to common problems. Capability patterns can be used as
building blocks to assemble delivery processes or larger capability patterns. </p>
Before
creating a capability pattern:<ul><li>Select a method plug-in to hold your process. For more information, see <a href="methodplugin.html#methodplugin">Method Plug-in</a>.</li>
<li>Find or create a process package.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">A capability pattern does not relate to any specific phase or iteration
of a development lifecycle, and should not imply any. In other words, a capability
pattern should be designed in a way so that it is applicable anywhere in a
delivery process. This enables the pattern's activities to be flexibly assigned
to whatever phases there are in the delivery process to which it is being
applied. For more information see <a href="capabilitypattern.html#capabilitypattern">Capability Pattern</a>.<div class="p">You do not need to develop your process from scratch;
you can reuse existing capability patterns or even capability pattern parts.
There are several ways to populate a process with method elements:<ul><li>By incorporating individual method elements by dragging the elements onto
an activity in the process.</li>
<li>By including already defined capability patterns.</li>
<li>By including parts of already defined capability patterns.</li>
<li>By creating descriptors directly in the process, which are either unrelated
to any method content or related to method content at a later point in time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> To create a capability pattern:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>Once you have selected or created a process package, right click
the <strong>Process Package</strong>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <strong>New â€“&gt; Capability Pattern</strong>. The New Process Component
dialog box appears.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Type a name for the capability pattern into the <strong>Name</strong> field
and then select a default configuration from the drop down list.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The process is created and the process editor
is opened.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the process editor, under the Description tab, document your
process using the available text fields.</span> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can use the
Rich Text Editor to edit or enter the text for any field that has a twisty
symbol <img src="twisty symbol1.JPG" alt="" />. Simply click
the symbol to access the Rich Text Editor. Click the symbol again to close
the Rich Text Editor. For more information see <a href="richtexteditor.html#richtexteditor">Rich Text Editor</a></div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Decide on your primary process authoring view. You develop a process
using three different views: </span><ul><li><strong>Work Breakdown Structure</strong>: Define a work breakdown structure
in your process. Create iterations and activities first, and then populate
your activities by applying tasks from your method content. For more information
see <a href="developaworkbreakdownstructure.html#developaworkbreakdownstructure">Develop a Work Breakdown Structure</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Team Allocation</strong>: Define which teams and roles shall participate
in activities and then find responsible work products and tasks from there.
For more information, see <a href="developateamallocationstructure.html">Develop a Team Allocation Structure</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Work Product Usage</strong>: Define which work products should be created
in activities and find tasks and roles from there. For more information see <a href="developaworkproductusagestructure.html#developaworkproductusagestructure">Develop a Work Product Usage Structure</a>.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Once you have created your capability pattern, you need to apply
it. For more information, please see <a href="applyacapabilitypattern.html#applyacapabilitypattern">Apply a Capability Pattern</a>.</p>
