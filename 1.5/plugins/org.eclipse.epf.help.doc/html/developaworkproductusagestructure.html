<h1 class="topictitle1">Develop a Work Product Usage Structure</h1>
<div><div class="p">In the Work Product Usage view, you can create a process by defining
which work products will be created and used in the process, and then finding
responsible roles and tasks from there. You can also review the work products
in a process that has been created by adding tasks or roles to the process.<p>Before
you create a work product usage structure, ensure the configuration selected
in the tool bar is the same as the configuration you selected as the default
configuration for your process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">To develop a work product usage structure:</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>To access the work product usage editor, select the <strong>Work Product
Usage</strong> tab in the process editor.</span> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For the purposes of
this topic, the breakdown element example used is <a href="activity.html#activity">Activity</a>. Other breakdown elements include (but are not limited
to) <a href="phase.html#phase">Phase</a> and <a href="iteration.html#iteration">Iteration</a>. The element you use depends on the scope of the process
you create.</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Right click the element (either a <a href="capabilitypattern.html#capabilitypattern">Capability Pattern</a> or <a href="deliveryprocess.html#deliveryprocess">Delivery Process</a>) to which you want to add structure, and then click <strong>New
Child &gt; Activity</strong> to create a new activity. If needed, create more activities
to set up your breakdown structure. Activities (as well as phases and iterations)
can be nested inside each other according to how each relates in the hierarchy.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Review the list of work products in the <a href="configurationview.html#configurationview">Configuration View</a>. In this view, work products are sorted by domain as
well as work product kinds. Drill into either of these hierarchies to see
which work products are available in this configuration.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select a work product to add to activity and then drag it on top
of the activity which you want it to belong. The work product is added as
a work product descriptor to that activity. If the work product is an output
to one or more tasks in the configuration, a wizard appears prompting you
to add the task. </span> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> It is not required to add a task. A valid
process can contain just roles and work products.</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Specify the entry and exit states of the work product for the activity
to which it was added.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Review the new work product descriptor details in the properties
view. If the properties view is not displayed, right click the work product
descriptor in the process editor, and then select <strong>Properties</strong>. Use the
tabs on the side of the properties view to review different aspects of the
work product descriptor. In the Properties view, you can also perform individual
modifications of the role descriptor, such as change the presentation name,
add textual descriptions, add entry and exit states, and more. When changing
the role descriptor's relationships under the Roles or Work Products tabs,
you can add new elements from your method content by clicking the <strong>Add...</strong> button,
or connect your role descriptor with tasks already present in this activity.
For more information, see <a href="processelementpropertiesview.html#processelementpropertiesview">Process Element Properties View</a>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Continue adding work products to your activities. </span></li>
