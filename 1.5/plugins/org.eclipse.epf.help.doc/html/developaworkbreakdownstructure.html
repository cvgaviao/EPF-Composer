<h1 class="topictitle1">Develop a Work Breakdown Structure</h1>
<div><div class="p">A work breakdown structure is a hierarchical breakdown of work, such
as activities, tasks, and steps, defining a process. <p>Before creating a
work breakdown structure, be sure that the configuration selected in the tool
bar is the same as the configuration selected as the default configuration
for your process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">To develop a work breakdown structure:</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>To access the work breakdown structure editor, select the <strong>Work
Breakdown Structure</strong> tab in a process editor.</span> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> A breakdown
structure is created with breakdown elements. Examples of breakdown elements
are <a href="phase.html#phase">Phase</a>, <a href="iteration.html#iteration">Iteration</a>, <a href="activity.html#activity">Activity</a>,
or task descriptor. Typically, a process is created by defining
its phases and iterations within or across these phases. Phases and iterations
are then further broken down into levels of activities. Finally, you can populate
a work breakdown structure's activity with task descriptors.</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Right click the element (either a <a href="capabilitypattern.html#capabilitypattern">Capability Pattern</a> or <a href="deliveryprocess.html#deliveryprocess">Delivery Process</a>) to which you want to add structure, and then click <strong>New
Child &gt; Activity</strong> to create the new activity. If needed, create more activities
to set up your breakdown structure. Activities (as well as phases and iterations)
can be nested inside each other according to how each relates in the hierarchy.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Right click the activity and then select <strong>Properties</strong> to open
the Properties view. Complete the information under the Documentation tab
for the activity. This information appears in the published Web page for the
activity.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Review the list of tasks in the configuration view to see which
tasks are available.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select a task to add to the breakdown structure and then drag it
on top of the activity to which you want it to belong. The task is added as
a task descriptor to that activity.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>If the properties view for the activity is not displayed, select
the task in the work breakdown structure editor, right click, and then select <strong>Properties</strong>.
Click the <strong>Documentation</strong> tab and then complete the information required
under this tab. This information appears in the published Web page for the
activity. Use the tabs on the side of the properties view to review different
aspects of the task descriptor. In the properties view, you can perform individual
modifications of the task descriptor, such as change the presentation name,
add textual descriptions, and change performing roles, among others. When
changing the task descriptor's relationships under the roles or work products
tabs, you can add new elements from your method content by clicking the <strong>Add...</strong> button,
or connect your task descriptor with tasks already present in this activity.
For more information, see <a href="processelementpropertiesview.html#processelementpropertiesview">Process Element Properties View</a>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Continue adding tasks to the activity or activities.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section">You can preview what your process will look like in a published Web
site at any time by switching to the <a href="browsingperspective.html#browingperspective">Browsing Perspective</a> and then selecting the process, or an activity in the
process, in the <a href="configurationview.html">Configuration View</a>. You can use the
links on the page to navigate through the process. Switch back to the <a href="authoringperspective.html#authoringperspective">Authoring Perspective</a> to
continue editing your process.</div>
