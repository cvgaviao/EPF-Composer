<h1 class="topictitle1">Extends</h1>
<div><p>An extending element inherits characteristics of the base element. Extension
allows Method Plug-ins to easily reuse elements from a base plug-in by providing
a kind of inheritance for the extending element. Attribute values and association
instances are inherited from the "based-on" element to the extending element.
The result is that the extending element has the same properties as the "based-on"
element, but might define its own additions. Extends is not used to modify
content of the base plug-in, but to provide the ability for the extending
plug-in to define its own content which is a variant of content already defined.
For example, a special version of a generic Review Record for a specific type
of review. The effect of this is that the base element and any number of extending
elements can be used side by side, but refer to each other through the extends
relationship. Extends also provides the key mechanism for binding capability
patterns to processes: A pattern is applied by defining an extends relationship
from an activity of the applying processes to the capability pattern. The
activity inherits association instances from the pattern and the pattern appears
to be part of the resulting process after interpretation.</p>
<p>Use the Content Variability section on the Description tab to make an element
extend another element. Select <strong>Extends</strong> as the Variability Type, and
then select the base element which this element extends. The base element
must be the same type of element as the extending element.</p>
<p>Any information you enter in the extending element is added to the base
element in creating an additional element. Text fields in the extending element
are added at the end of the respective text fields in the base element.</p>
<p>Extends only defines inheritance for the extending element. The base remains
untouched. If the extending element is allowed an association to only one
other element and has such an element defined itself, inheritance will not
override this association.</p>
<div class="p"><strong>Extends rules:</strong><ul><li>Attribute values of the base element are inherited to the extending element
if the extending element has not defined its own values.</li>
<li>Outgoing to-many associations of the base element are inherited to the
extending element.</li>
<li>Outgoing to-one associations are only inherited if the extending element
does not define its own to-one association.</li>
<li>Extends works transitively, i.e. if an extending element is extended itself,
the second extension inherits from its direct and indirect base elements.</li>
<li>Contribution precedes Extends, i.e. contribution is evaluated first and
then extending elements inherit afterwards from the base element (including
all of its contribution).</li>
<li>Replace precedes Extends, i.e. if a base element has a replace and extends
relationship, the extending element inherits from the replacing element.</li>
</ul>

type.</div>
