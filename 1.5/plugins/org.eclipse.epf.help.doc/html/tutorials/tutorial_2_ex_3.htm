<h2><a></a><a>Exercise 3: Create Roles </a></h2>
<p>To create a Role in My Content Package: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Make sure you are in the <strong>Authoring </strong> perspective. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within My Content Package right-click on the <strong>Roles </strong> folder. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Highlight <strong>New </strong> and then click <strong>Role</strong>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <strong>Name field </strong> type: my_rup_user_interface_designer. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <strong>Presentation Name</strong> field type: My UI Designer. </p>
  </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Brief Description </strong> field type: </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The user-interface designer coordinates the design of the user interface. User-interface designers are also involved in gathering usability requirements and prototyping candidate user-interface designs to meet those requirements. </p>
    <p><strong>Tip </strong> - there are different ways that you can create the text above for the new role: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; Directly, by typing it manually in the EPF Composer editor. </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; By copying from another similar role and then modify using the editors (e.g. rup_user_interface_designer). </p>
    &#149;&nbsp;By copying from an html source such as the tutorial you are reading. </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <li>    Try the <strong>Rich Text Editor </strong> for editing the <strong>Main Description. </strong>You can open the Rich Text Editor for any item that has a ‘twisty' <img width="13" height="13" src="tutorial_2_ex_3_clip_image002.gif">symbol 
    <blockquote>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; The user-interface designer role is not responsible for implementing the user interface. Instead, this role focuses on the design and the &quot;visual shaping&quot; of the user interface, by: </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p> - Capturing requirements on the user interface, including usability requirements. </p>
      <p>- Building user-interface prototypes.</p>
      <p>- Involving other stakeholders of the user interface, such as end-users, in usability reviews and use testing sessions. </p>
      <p>- Reviewing and providing the appropriate feedback on the final implementation of the user interface, as created by other developers; that is, designers and implementers. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Note</strong> – if you copy text from a Microsoft Word document you will get a lot of formatting information that is not needed in Eclipse Process Framework Composer. You can see this if you open the HTML editor in the Rich Text Editor. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>WorkProducts </strong> tab; make this new role responsible for the my_rup_navmap and my_rup_user_interface_prototype artifacts that you previously created. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Add </strong> button. This displays a selection dialog where you can select the Work Products to add. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Once you have selected the appropriate Work Products, click <strong>OK</strong>. The work products you selected appear in the <strong>Responsible for: </strong> panel. 
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note that selected elements in an Add/Remove section display both the element name and the ‘path' to that element – the Plugin name and package name. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Preview </strong> tab to view the newly created role and then save by closing the editor. </li>
</ol>
