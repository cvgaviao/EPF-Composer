<h2><a>Exercise 1: Publishing a pre-defined configuration </a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to publish a <strong>Configuration </strong>that is included in Eclipse Process Framework Composer. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Select the <strong>Authoring </strong> perspective. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    In the <strong>Library View</strong>, open the Configurations folder and select the configuration: My RUP for Small Projects. This opens the Configuration Editor. 
    <p>The Plug in and Package Selection tab shows the plug-ins and packages within each plug-in that are included in the Configuration. The plug-ins and packages in the Configuration can be adjusted by selecting and deselecting them in the tree display. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    Review <strong>Configuration </strong><strong>Views </strong>: (i.e. how the published site will be laid out). 
    <p>Select the <strong>Views </strong> tab in the configuration editor. A View is a Custom Category that is designed for publication. Required packages and content elements are assigned to a Custom Category. The Custom Category can then be added as a View to a Configuration. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    Select <strong>Default</strong> View.
    <p>One of the views can be selected as the Default View by selecting the View and clicking the ‘Make Default' button. When the configuration is published, the Default View will be selected when the published configuration is opened in the EPF Composer Browser. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Close the configuration editor. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Select <strong>My RUP for Small Projects</strong> in the configuration selection box in the EPF Composer toolbar. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Select <strong>Configuration &gt; Publish </strong> from the main menu bar. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    Step through Publish wizard, accepting the defaults, and publish the configuration. It will take a few minutes to generate the web site. Assuming that you have the right java environment, the EPF Composer Browser applet should launch allowing you to view the resulting published web site (accept the security warnings when the applet fires up). </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note: </strong> The published web site has a richer organization and lay-out as defined by the Configuration View, as compared to the more simple view of the configuration content available within the EPF Composer <strong>Configuration View</strong>. </p>
