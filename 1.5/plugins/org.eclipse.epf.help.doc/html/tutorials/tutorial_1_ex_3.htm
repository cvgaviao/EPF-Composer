<h2><a>Exercise 3: Browse Process Content via Browsing Perspective </a></h2>
<p> The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with browsing process content in a library using the browsing perspective </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you are in the Browsing perspective. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To view a Capability Pattern, click <strong>Processes &gt; Capability Patterns &gt; Classic RUP &gt; Discipline Workflows &gt; Analysis and Design</strong>. A preview of the published Web page for the selected Capability Pattern is displayed. </p>
  </li>
  <li>A Capability Pattern contains a large amount of information and is displayed over four tabs – Description, Work Breakdown Structure, Work Product Usage and Team Allocation. Explore the information on each tab. 
    <p>Note that when you click on a task in the Work Breakdown Structure tab you preview a ‘Task Descriptor'. A Task Descriptor is a task within a process. The task descriptor page has information about the task as it is used at a specific point in a process. The task descriptor has a link to the Task on which it is based. </p>
    <p>Clicking on a role or work product in a task descriptor takes you to a Role Descriptor or a Work Product Descriptor. These provide information about the role or work product at the same point in the process and also provide links back to the core method element on which they are based. </p>
  </li>
  <li>To view a Delivery Process, click <strong>Processes &gt; Delivery Processes &gt; Classic RUP Lifecycle</strong>. The display for a Delivery Process is similar to a Capability Pattern. </li>
