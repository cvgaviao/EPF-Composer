<h2><a></a><a>Exercise 3: Create a Delivery Process </a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to create a delivery process using core method content directly. </p>
<p>In <strong>Process Authoring </strong> we do not directly include the definitions of the core method elements in the WBS but rather create local references termed <strong>descriptors </strong> that refer back to the elements in the method library but also contain additional information that is only relevant to the local process. </p>
<p>Descriptors also provide a mechanism whereby relationships defined in core method authoring (e.g. roles associated with a task, input and output, work products, etc.), can be defined or changed locally within the process. </p>
<ol>
  <li>    Create a new Delivery Process in the My Plugin, plug-in called, My RUP. </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When you create a process you are asked to identify the default Configuration to be used with the process. Select the My RUP for Small Projects configuration. If you nave not created this configuration, select RUP for Small Projects. </p>
    <p>A process has a hierarchy of activities and can include the special types of activity – Phases and Iterations. These structures can also be created in Capability Patterns. First of all, we'll create some activities directly and reuse some capability patterns later. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>
    <p> To create the Inception Phase, in the Work Breakdown Structure view, right click the <strong>My RUP </strong>Process, and then select, <strong>New Child &gt; Phase </strong>. Call the Phase, <strong>Inception</strong>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    
    <p>To create the Requirements Discipline in Inception, in the <strong>Work Breakdown Structure </strong> view, right click <strong>Inception, </strong> and select <strong>New </strong><strong>Child &gt; Activity </strong>. Call this <strong>Requirements</strong>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>To add Tasks to the Requirements activity, in the <strong>Configuration </strong> view, open the Requirements Discipline and then drag and drop the following tasks onto the Requirements Activity you have just created:  </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp; Develop Vision </p>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp; Detail the Software Requirements </p>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp; Find Actors and use Cases </p>
    <p>When you include these tasks in your process, the associated roles and work products are also included in the process. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>
    <p> You can review the information for each method element in the <strong>Properties </strong> view. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Customize the steps from the Find Actors and Use Cases task for the Inception phase. Click on the <strong>Find Actors and Use Cases</strong> task descriptor, and open the <strong>Properties</strong> view. Click on the <strong>Steps</strong> tab. Remove the last four steps and close the properties view. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Switch to the <strong>Browsing</strong> perspective and select <strong>Processes &gt; Delivery Processes &gt; My RUP</strong>. The Work Breakdown Structure tab is displayed. Click on <strong>Find Actors and Use Cases</strong>. Only the first three steps from the core method task are included. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Make other changes to the tasks in the delivery process you have just created and see how they are reflected when you view the process in the Browsing perspective.</li>
</ol>
