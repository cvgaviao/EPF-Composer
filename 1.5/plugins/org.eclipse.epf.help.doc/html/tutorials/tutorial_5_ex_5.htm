<h2><a></a><a>Exercise 5: Create Process Diagrams </a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to explore the diagram features of Eclipse Process Framework Composer. </p>
<p>EPF Composer supports three types of process diagram. These are: </p>
<blockquote>
        <p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Activity Diagram</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>            This shows the (sub) activities in a higher level activity. It shows the sequence relationships between the activities. </p>
        </blockquote>
  <p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Activity Detail</strong> – similar to RUP Workflow Detail </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>      This shows the tasks in an activity with their performing roles and input and output work products. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Work Product Dependency Diagram</strong> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This diagram can be used to show how a work product is dependent on other work products. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>These diagrams can then be included in the published web site. The diagrams are automatically generated (to a degree) and inherently synchronized with the WBS. Changes to the process structure using the diagram editor are automatically reflected in the WBS, and vice versa. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to <strong>Authoring </strong> perspective. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the My RUP delivery process that you have been working on. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Highlight the delivery process in the WBS and then right-click. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Diagrams &gt; Open Activity Diagram</strong>. The diagram editor should open, showing the top level activities - phases. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expand the <strong>Palette </strong> on the right of the diagram view. All the elements required to create an <strong>Activity Diagram </strong> are available on the palette. Add a new phase to the diagram – call it, Construction. Create links between the phases to show the sequence of the phases. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch back to the <strong>Work Breakdown Structure </strong>view and notice the new phase. Also notice that the links you added on the diagram are reflected in the Predecessors column. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double click the <strong>Inception Phase</strong> in the diagram – it will drill down to show the contained Activities (the rule is that the editor will display the process elements at the level below the current selected element). Successive drill down through the levels is possible by clicking on the diagram elements. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close the diagrams you have opened. </p>
  </li>
  <li>In the Work Breakdown Structure, right-click on the Requirements activity and select, <strong>Diagrams &gt; Open Activity Detail Diagram. </strong>The Activity Detail Diagram is automatically generated. It shows:  </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp; The Roles that perform tasks in the activity </p>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp; The Tasks that the roles perform </p>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp; The input and output work products for each task </p>
    <p>You can change the layout of the diagram but you cannot add or remove any elements from the diagram. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>
    <p>Close the diagrams you have opened. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    In the Work Breakdown Structure, right-click on the Requirements activity and select, <strong>Diagrams &gt; Open Work Product Dependency Diagram. </strong>The work products used in the activity are automatically added to the diagram.  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>Add a (dependency) link between two work products. This indicates that the work product at the arrow end of the link is dependent on the other work product, i.e., the other work product needs to be created in order to create the second work product.
  </p>
  <p>Add a work product descriptor to the diagram. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="12">
  <li>
    <p>Switch back to the delivery process and open the <strong>Work Product Usage</strong> view. Notice the new work product in the Requirements activity. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have edited a diagram, you can choose to include it or exclude it when publishing the process in a configuration. In the Work Breakdown Structure, right-click on the <strong>Requirements</strong> activity and select <strong>Diagrams &gt; Publishing Options. </strong>Check or uncheck the types of diagram listed. If a diagram type is not listed, it means that you have not edited that diagram type for the activity yet. </p>
  </li>
