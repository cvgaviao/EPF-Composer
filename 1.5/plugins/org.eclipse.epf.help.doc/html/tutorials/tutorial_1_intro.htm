<h1><a>Tutorial: 


 Navigate the User Interface

</a></h1>
<h2><a>Introduction </a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to get familiar with user interface and the way method and process content is stored and viewed. </p>
<p>A Method Library consists of a series of <strong><em>method plug-ins. </em></strong>Within a plugin, content is separated into <strong><em>Method Content </em></strong> (tasks, roles, work products and guidance) and <strong><em>Processes </em></strong> (capability patterns and delivery processes). This is how the Library View, which shows all the content in the library is organized. </p>
<p>A configuration is a subset of the method library content. The Configuration View shows the content in the currently selected configuration. Once a configuration is selected, the configuration view is refreshed with the content from the configuration. The content in the configuration view is always laid out using the same set of folders regardless of which configuration is selected. </p>
<p>EPF Composer has two ‘perspectives'. The Authoring Perspective provides full browsing and authoring capabilities. The Browsing Perspective allows browsing content in the currently selected configuration. </p>
<p>Content is created and maintained using a series of <strong><em>editors. </em></strong></p>
