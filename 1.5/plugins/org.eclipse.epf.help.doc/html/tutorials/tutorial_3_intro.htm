<h1><a></a><a>Tutorial: Create Reusable Method Content </a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to understand the variety of ways in which the content in a base plug-in can be extended and modified by content in other plug-ins. </p>
<p>The ‘Create Core Method Content' tutorial shows how to create new content in a plug-in. In this tutorial we will see how to extend existing content in a plug-in. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>In the following exercises we create separate Content Packages to demonstrate each of the ways that a method plug-in can modify content in another plug-in (i.e. extends, replaces, and/or contributes). This is for easy illustration of the effect of applying each type of method element variability. </p>
Managing content via the Method Plug-in mechanism is a key and very powerful feature of EPF Composer. This tutorial explores the effects of the different variability types in the following exercises.
