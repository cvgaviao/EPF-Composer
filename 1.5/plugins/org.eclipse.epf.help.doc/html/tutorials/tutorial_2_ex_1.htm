<h2><a></a><a>Exercise 1: Create or Modify a Method Content Package </a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this task is to create a new <strong>Content Package </strong> within a <strong>Method Plug-in</strong>. </p>
<p>To create a new Method Plug-in: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Make sure you are in the <strong>Authoring </strong> perspective. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Method Plug-in</strong>. 
    <p>Or </p>
    <p>Right-click an existing Plug-in and select <strong>New Method Plug-in</strong>. <br>
  The New Method Plug-in wizard is launched. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the New Method Plug-in wizard, provide a name for the new plug-in. In this instance, we'll call it My Plugin. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select <strong>RUP </strong> in the Referenced Plug-ins panel, and then click <strong>Finish</strong>. This means that your plug-in will extend the RUP plug-in and you will be able to select content from the RUP plug-in as you create your own plug-in content. <br>
      <span class="style1">My Plugin</span> now appears in the Library View on the left side of your screen. It is not grayed out indicating that it is not locked and that you can edit it. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Double click on <span class="style1">My Plugin</span> to open the Plugin editor. About halfway down the page you will see the ‘Lock Plugin' checkbox. This will be unchecked for your new plugin. If you open the plugin editor for the RUP plugin this field will be checked. </li>
</ol>
<p>To create a Method Package: </p>
<ol start="6">
  <li>
    <p>In the Library View, click <strong>My Plugin &gt; Method Content &gt; Content Packages</strong>.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right-click <strong>Content Packages</strong>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Highlight <strong>New</strong> and then click <strong>Content Package</strong> to create a new Content Package. <br>
      The Content Package editor is displayed and you can name the package and provide a Brief Description. We'll call it “My Content Package”. <br>
      <strong>Note: </strong> You cannot create a new Content Package or any other element in a locked plugin. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Save your new content. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong> When you create a new element or modify an existing element, a ‘*' appears in the tab next to the name of the element, indicating that the element needs to be saved. An element can be saved by closing the editor, clicking the disk icon in the toolbar, or clicking <strong>File &gt; Save </strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong> EPF Composer automatically creates nodes for tasks, roles, work products and guidance under the new content package. </p>
