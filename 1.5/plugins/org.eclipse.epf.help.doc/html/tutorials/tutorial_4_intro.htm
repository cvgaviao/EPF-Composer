<h1><a>Tutorial: Publishing and Exporting </a></h1>
<p>EPF Composer is essentially a content management application. The ultimate output of EPF Composer is a Web site with published method guidance and processes that can be viewed by a project team. </p>
<p>EPF Composer makes it easy to configure a process for a particular type or size of project and to publish the guidance to a Web site. A Method <strong>Configuration </strong> is a selection of <strong>Content Packages </strong> across different <strong>Method Plug-ins </strong> containing the method and process content that will be included in the published web site. At publishing time, the configuration is combined with different Method <strong>Views </strong> which define the website's navigation structures and content organization. </p>
<p>The EPF Composer <strong>Browsing Perspective </strong> renders the Method <strong>Configuration </strong> content in html format within EPF Composer, providing a navigable representation of the method/process content associated with that Configuration. </p>
<p>This tutorial uses content that is created in the ‘Create Core Method Content' and ‘Extending base method content using Variability' tutorials. </p>
