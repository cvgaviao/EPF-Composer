<h2><a>Exercise 5: Search for Method Content </a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with the search function in Eclipse Process Framework Composer. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to <strong>Authoring </strong>perspective. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Open up the Search dialog by : </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp; Clicking on the Flashlight icon in the toolbar </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Or </strong></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp; Selecting <strong>Search / Search</strong> in the main menu. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the <strong>Method Search</strong> tab. Enter <span class="style1">Database</span> in the text box and click on <strong>Search</strong>. It will take a few seconds to find all the hits. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drill down in the search results and double-click on an element. The editor for the selected item is opened. If you have <strong>Link with Editor</strong> selected in the library view, the library view display changes to show you where the selected item is in the library. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the search dialog again and repeat the same search but this time reduce the scope to just look for tasks. Uncheck all the other content types in the scope panel. The search should be quicker and result in fewer hits. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the search dialog again and repeat the same search but this time add <strong>rup_*</strong> as a file name pattern. Make sure the scope is still set to tasks. The search should be even quicker and result in even fewer hits. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Experiment with other Method Searches.</li>
</ol>
