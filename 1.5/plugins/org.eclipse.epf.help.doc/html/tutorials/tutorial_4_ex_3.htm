<h2><a>Exercise 3: Create a customized configuration </a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to create your own customized configuration. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you are in the <strong>Authoring </strong> perspective. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Configuration</strong>. Or, you can right-click on the <strong>Configurations</strong> folder in the Library View and select <strong>New Configuration. </strong>The Configuration Editor is launched.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Name the configuration, <span class="style1">my_configuration</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Click on the <strong>Plug-in and Package Selection </strong> tab. In the list of Plugins, check My Plugin that you created in the <u>Create Core Method Content</u> tutorial. This plugin has RUP as a base and references parts of the RUP content, and also has elements that extend, contribute to, and replace base RUP content. <br>
      If you do not have this plugin, consider completing the <u>Create Core Method Content</u> tutorial before continuing with this tutorial. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> The display will give you a series of warnings and the Library Error Log view will be displayed. <br>
      Eclipse Process Framework Composer gives these warnings to help ensure that you create a configuration that ‘makes sense'. If you reference an element, you will only be able to see the full details for that element in a published web site if the package containing the element is in the configuration. If the package containing the element is not in the configuration, the ‘offending' package is marked as a warning – you may choose not to include the full details of the referenced element. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Check the <strong>Add Missing References</strong> button. This will automatically and recursively add packages containing any elements that are referenced in already selected packages. Explore what packages have been added to the configuration. You will probably now see all of RUP selected. This is because of the inter-connected nature of RUP. Uncheck RUP to restore the warnings. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Drill down into the content packages in the My Plugin, plugin package   by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> signs. Uncheck the<strong> Extends Test </strong>and <strong>Replace Test </strong>content packages. Unchecking these avoids conflicts that may occur because the same base element is affected by the plugins. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> There should be a <strong>+</strong> by the <strong>Contribution Test</strong> package. Click the <strong>Make Closure by Fixing Errors</strong> button. This automatically makes your configuration complete based on what is currently selected. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Drill down into the RUP plugin, and see what packages have been selected. These will be the packages that contain the elements used as base elements in the Configuration Test content package. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    Click on the <strong>Views</strong> tab. 
    <p>Any custom category can be added as a view to a configuration. You can created any number of custom categories and they are very flexible in terms of the content that you can add to a custom category and in the order in which the content appears. </p>
    <p>Add the <span class="style1">my_custom_category</span> custom category as a view in the configuration. </p>
    <p>Experiment with adding other custom categories as views. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Make <span class="style1">my_custom_category</span> the default view by selecting the <span class="style1">my_custom_category</span> tab and clicking the <strong>Make Default</strong> button. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Save the configuration by closing the Configuration Editor. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Select <span class="style1">my_configuration</span> in the configuration selection box at the top of the screen. You will see the items displayed in the Configuration View change. </p>
  </li>
  <li> Switch to the <strong>Browsing</strong> perspective. Explore the content in the configuration view. You should see the content you created in your plugins and some RUP content. </li>
</ol>
