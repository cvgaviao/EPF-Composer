<h2><a>Exercise 4: Publishing a custom configuration </a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Select <strong>Configuration &gt; Publish </strong> from the main menu bar. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Select my-configuration in the list of configurations. </p>
  </li>
  <li> Step through Publish wizard, accepting the defaults, and publish the configuration. It will take a few minutes to generate the web site. Assuming that you have the right java environment, the EPF Composer Browser applet should launch allowing you to view the resulting published web site (accept the security warnings when the applet fires up). </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note: </strong> The published web site has a richer organization and lay-out as defined by the Configuration View, as compared to the more simple view of the configuration content available within the EPF Composer <strong>Configuration View </strong>. </p>
