<h2><a>Exercise 1: Explore the User Interface </a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with the major parts of the Eclipse Process Framework Composer user interface. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Switch perspective. The current perspective is displayed near the top right of the screen. You will see either Authoring or Browsing. Click on the <strong>Open Perspective</strong> icon, and select the other perspective. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explore the <strong>Library</strong> <strong>View</strong>. The library view is available in authoring perspective – it is not shown in the browsing perspective. The Library View shows you all the content in the current library. The highest level content unit is a plugin. Click on some <strong>+</strong> signs and explore the content. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drill down into a plugin as follows: <strong>Method Content &gt; Content Packages &gt; [any] &gt; Tasks</strong>. Double click on a task. The Task Editor is displayed on the right of the screen. There are separate editors for the different types of content that you can create in a library. Each editor has a series of tabs and a number of form elements on each tab. You can find out more about these in the <u>Create Method Content </u>tutorial. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Preview </strong> tab. A preview of an HTML page is displayed. This is what the selected element will look like in a published web site. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to the <strong>browsing perspective</strong>. The Configuration View is now displayed. The configuration view always has the same structure but the content changes based on which configuration is currently selected. Drill down into the Disciplines folder until you get to tasks and click on a task. The HTML preview of the selected item is shown on the right of the screen. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch configurations. The current configuration is displayed in the selection box below the main menu bar. Select a configuration from the drop down list. You will see the Configuration View refresh when you do this. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Switch to the <strong>authoring</strong> <strong>perspective</strong>. Drill down into a plugin as follows: <strong>Processes &gt; Capability Patterns &gt; [any] &gt; Capability Patterns</strong>. Note that not all plugins have capability patterns. Double-click on a capability pattern. The right side of the screen is now filled with the Capability Pattern editor and the Properties View. You can find out more about these in the <u>Working with Processes</u> tutorial.</li>
