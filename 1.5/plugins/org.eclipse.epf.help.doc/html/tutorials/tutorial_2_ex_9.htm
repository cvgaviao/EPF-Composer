<h2><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a>Exercise 9: </a>Adding Your Plug-in to the Configuration View </h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to include your plug-in in a configuration. </p>
<p>Before your new elements can be seen in the Configuration View, you need to first add your new plug-in to a configuration. We'll add the new plug-in to the Config for RUP configuration and see the results in the Configuration View. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to the <strong>Browsing </strong>perspective and in the <strong>Configuration View </strong>try to find your new content. For example look for My Design Roleset. You shouldn't see it. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Switch to the <strong>Authoring </strong>perspective and then click <strong>Configurations </strong> at the bottom of the tree display. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Make a copy of the <strong>RUP for Small Projects </strong> configuration. Right-click on the <strong>RUP for Small Projects </strong> configuration and select <strong>Copy </strong>. Then right-click on the Configurations folder and click <strong>Paste </strong>. Name the new configuration <strong>My RUP for Small Projects. </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Double-click on the <strong>My RUP for Small Projects </strong> configuration to open the Configuration Editor. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Click on the <strong>Plug-in and Package Selection</strong> tab. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Add <strong>My Plugin </strong> to the configuration by checking the box next to it in the Configuration Components field. If you expand <strong>My Plugin </strong> you will see that the full contents of the plug-in have been selected. 
      You may see some errors in the Library Error Log view. You can click through these errors or ignore them for now. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Close the editor and save the changes. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Change the current configuration to <strong>My RUP for Small Projects </strong>in the configuration selection box in the EPF Composer toolbar, just below the main menu bar. </p>
  </li>
  <li> Switch to the <strong>Browsing </strong> perspective and now look for your content in the <strong>Configuration View</strong>. You should now see <strong>My Design Roleset </strong>. You should also see your new Work Products in the Uncategorized folder under Domains. </li>
</ol>
