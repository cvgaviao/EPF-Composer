<h2><a></a><a>Exercise 2: Create Work Product</a>s </h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to create new method content. Specifically, <strong>Work Products </strong>of type <strong> Artifact </strong>. You can create any content but some examples are provided if you want to use them. These examples are referred to in other tutorials. </p>
<p>Method and Process elements have two names in EPF Composer: Name and Presentation Name. </p>
<p>The Name field is used as the file name for the item. In RUP, we are careful how we name the files and use conventions such as lower case, no spaces, and no special characters. We do this so that the name is a valid file name on all operating systems and for integration with source control software in the future. The Name is shown in the Library View. </p>
<p>The Presentation Name is the name that is shown on published pages and it is also shown in the Configuration View. This name can contain any characters, but by convention in RUP, we use the same text as the Name, just prettier. </p>
<p>In the Library view you can choose to display Names or Presentation Names. You can switch the name display using the ‘Show Presentation Names' button in the Library view toolbar. </p>
<p>In general, you create new elements by right-clicking the folder that will contain the new element. For example, to create a new role in a content package, right-click the <strong>Roles </strong> folder, highlight <strong>New </strong> and then click <strong>Role</strong>. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you are in the <strong>Authoring </strong> perspective. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Within <span class="style1">My Content Package</span> right-click on the <strong>Work Products</strong> folder. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Highlight <strong>New</strong> and then click <strong>Artifact</strong>. The artifact editor is displayed. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> In the Name field, type the new Artifact name. In this instance, we'll call it <strong>my_rup_navmap</strong>. </p>
  </li>
  <li> In the <strong>Presentation Name</strong> field, type: </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p>My RUP Navigation Map</p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>In the <strong>Brief Description</strong> field, type:
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Navigation Map expresses the structure of the user-interface elements in the system, along with their potential navigation pathways.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> In the <strong>Purpose</strong> field type: 
    <blockquote>
      <p>There is one Navigation Map per system. The purpose of the Navigation Map is to express the principal user interface paths through the system. These are the main pathways through the screens of the system and not necessarily all of the possible paths. It can be thought of as a road map of the system's user interface. The Navigation Map makes it easy to see how many &quot;clicks&quot; it will take a user to get to a specific screen. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the preview tab to view the new Artifact. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Save the Artifact. </p>
  </li>
  <li> Repeat steps 2 through 9 using the following information: 
    <blockquote>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Artifact Name</strong>: my_rup_user_interface_prototype </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Presentation Name</strong>: My RUP UI Prototype </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Brief Description</strong>: A user-interface prototype is an example of the user interface that is built in order to explore and/or validate the user-interface design. </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Purpose: </strong> The following roles use the user-interface prototype: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>- <strong>user-interface designers</strong> , to explore and/or validate the user-interface design before too much is invested in it </p>
        <p>- <strong>requirements specifiers </strong>, to understand the user interface for a Use Case </p>
        <p><strong>- system analysts </strong>, to understand how the user interface impacts the analysis of the system </p>
        <p>- <strong>designers </strong>, to understand how the user interface impacts and what it requires from the &quot;inside&quot; of the system </p>
        <p> - <strong>managers </strong>, to plan development and testing activities </p>
      </blockquote>
